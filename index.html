  <meta name="description" content="Vision research is one of the most active areas within brain research.
Psychologists,neuroscientists, opthamologists and optometrists,computer scientists, and engineers all have an interest in the practical side of the subject. The research interests of this group are to understand the physiological mechanisms of visual Neural Mechanism, cognition and computation at different levels, and to build computational models available to the fields of both experimental neuroscience and computer vision.">
